# Admin-Dashboard
This is a static Admin Dashboard built using HTML and CSS.

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS curriculum. The objective was to recreate the provided [design file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png) to reinforce my understanding of modern layout techniques, specifically CSS Grid and Flexbox and how they can be combined to create flexible page layouts effectively.
